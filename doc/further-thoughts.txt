It would be really cool to integrate our color locker with a2ps to
produce quick and nice looking output.

It would also be nice to build autoindenters a la lint.

Also, it would be cool to build indenters for emacs and vi.

Lastly, it would be cool if you could generate etags backend programs,
so emacs could browse your source code with ease.
